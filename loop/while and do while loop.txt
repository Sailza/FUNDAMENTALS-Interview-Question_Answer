WHAT IS WHILE AND DO-WHILE LOOP  

do-while loop  
It is similar to the while loop the only difference between while and do while loop is that in a do while loop,
the test condition is tested at the end of the loop. 
This implies that the body of the loop is executed at least once without checking the condition.
The do while loop is a bottom-checking loop, as the control statement is placed after the body of the loop. 


while loop 
A while loop is also called a top-checking loop as the control condition is placed at the very first line of the code.
If the control condition evaluates to false, then the statements enclosed in the loop are never executed.


The main difference between while and do-while loops is that the do-while loop executes at least one timeeven if the condition is false 
but while loop get terminate if the condition is false

QUESTION 1 
What will be the output of the C program?

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
		int i = 0;
		while(i < 3, i = 0, i < 5)
		{
			printf("Loop ");
			i++;
		}
	return 0;
}
SOLUTION 
INFINITE LOOP 

Explanation
The while loop have a condition (i < 3, i = 0, i < 5) is in a format (expression1, expression2, expression3). In each interation the compiler checks each expression. 
In this program, the loop will be:
Iteration 1: 0 < 3, 0, 0 < 5
Iteration 2: 1 < 3, 0, 0 < 5
Iteration 3: 1 < 3, 0, 0 < 5
Iteration 4: 1 < 3, 0, 0 < 5
the loop continues as infinite because i is intialized to 0 each time.

QUESTION-2
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int i == 4, j == 7;
	while(++i < --j)
		printf("Loop")
	return 0;
}

SOLUTION 
LOOP 

Explanation
The while(--i == --j) is (5 < 6), so the statement inside the loop will executes once, 
if we go for antother iteration the condition will be wrong.

======================================================================================================================================================================

QUESTION -3 
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int i = 0;
	while(i++)
	{
		printf("Loop ");
		if(i == 3)
			break;
	}
return 0;
}

SOLUTION 
PRINTS NOTHING 

Explanation
The condition is while(i++), the expression is post incremented variable. 
So when it is applied for first time the condition will be False because while(0).

=======================================================================================================================================================================

QUESTION-4
#include<stdio.h>
#define NULL 0
int main()
{
	while (NULL == 0)
	{
		printf("Loop");
		break;
	}
	return 0;
}

SOLUTIONS 
LOOP 

EXPLANATION 
The condition is true so it returns 1 and excutes the block only once.

============================================================================================================================================

QUESTION-5 
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	int i = 4;
	while(i == 4--)
		printf("Loop ");
	return 0;
}

SOLUTION 
COMPILATION ERROR 

Explanation
Compilation Error: Lvalue Required
We can't use pre or post increment operator with constants or Literal values. 
So it will raise an error at compile time.
